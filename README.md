# PDFSearch
Search PDF file using PDF.js

This is a utility project for display and search PDF file in objective-c using
PDF.js (https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js).

# Purpose
As it is very complex task to search PDF in iOS i decided to create 
a simple and rebust utility class for all for free. Then i got this
PDF.js(a javascript file developer by mozilla.org), so that i modified
the .html and javascript files and integrated it with UIWebView.

# How to use
I create a sample project here for how to use it. and also if you have
any problem please do contact or throw questions over here.

# Feature planning
Well this is my first open soure utility class, and i wish this will help you all
i will soon upload same code for swift also and add more function like downlad pdf
into device, Open pdf file from device .. etc
